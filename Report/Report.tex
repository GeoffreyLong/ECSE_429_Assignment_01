%%%%%%% SECTIONS %%%%%%%
% Describe how to run your source code to generate the test class for a given state machine (xml file) and corresponding implementation of the state machine. This description should work for the CCoinBox example but also for the unknown state machine and its implementation.
% In a few paragraphs, discuss which manual changes you had to make to the generated test class to get the complete test class and why you had to make those manual changes instead of automatically generating the test code.
% In one paragraph, describe whether you found any defects in the implementation of the CCoinBox example. For each found defect, describe how you fixed it.
% In one paragraph, discuss what would be the main challenge to automate the generation of sneak path test cases from a given state machine conforming to the metamodel in Figure 1.
